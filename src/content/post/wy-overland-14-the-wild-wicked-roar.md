It's 1:00 PM on May 5th, 1864 -- Grant had given the order, Warren has given the signal, and now Griffin and Wadsworth's divisions are emerging from the eastern edge of Saunders Field to pitch into the enemy. However, as the bugles sound and the men rise to their feet, a "wild and wicked roar" erupts from the Confederate defenses just as Col. Paddy Ryan and his 140th New York Zouaves charge forward and race across 400 yards of open ground.
