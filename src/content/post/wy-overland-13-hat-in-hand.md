Overland Season 1 - Episode 13

## In This Episode

It's 1:00 PM on May 5th, 1864 -- Grant has had enough of both General Meade's and General Warren's excuses and has now directed them to send Griffin and Wadsworth's divisions forward and pitch into the enemy at once. Unfortunately, Grant does not yet know that General Sedgwick's 6th Corps, overcome by the tangles of The Wilderness, will not arrive on Griffin's RIGHT flank for hours. Worse yet, Wadsworth's men are also stuck trying to push through the dense Wilderness. When the order comes to march, Griffin's men will be stepping out into an open cornfield to confront the enemy... alone.
