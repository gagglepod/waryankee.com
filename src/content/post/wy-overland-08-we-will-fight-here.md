## In This Episode

It's dawn on May 5th, 1864 -- Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, Major General George Meade, and the Army of the Potomac have spent the night in the fabled WILDERNESS. Now, as the morning sun rises on a new day, what started as an easy march out of the thickets quickly spins out of control after a series of unexpected enemy surprises.

## Notable Quotes

_"My pickets report nothing new from the enemy this morning."_<br />
**-- Brig.Gen. Wilson's Scouting Report Regarding Orange Plank Road from Parker's Store sent to Maj.Gen. Meade at 5:00 AM, May 5th, 1864**

_"An unconfirmed report placed enemy soldiers on the Orange Turnpike. Concluding that Griffin probably faced an inconsequential rebel diversionary force. [...] I have no intention of modifying my corps' movements."_<br />
**-- Maj.Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, Commander, US Army V Corps**

_"If they want to fight here, then we will fight here!"_<br />
**-- Lt.Gen. Ulysses S. Grant**

_"What had begun as a hopeful morning's march was rapidly taking an ugly, familiar turn. Once again, the Union high command had underestimated Lee's audacity."_<br />
**-- Gordon Rhea, Battle of the Wilderness**
