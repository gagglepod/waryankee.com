## In This Episode

It's 1:00 PM May 5th, 1864 -- General Warren has ordered his division commanders Griffin and Wadsworth forward to pitch into the enemy now lurking on the opposite side of Saunders Field. While General Ayers's 140th New York Zouaves are the first to be bloodied, another of Griffin's brigade commanders -- General Joseph J. Bartlett -- moves across the field with enough momentum to smash a hole into the teeth of the rebel defenses. Will it be enough to carry the day?

## Notable Quotes

_"When the order was given to advance all three brigades started on the double-quick with a yell, driving the enemy in confusion back upon his reserves."_
**-- Samuel L. Miller, a veteran historian of the 20th Maine**

_"They were splendidly in line. Moved rapidly, their colors all unfurled, and formed as they advanced one of the finest battle pictures that I can remember."_
**-- Soldier from the 1st Michigan**

_"A red volcano yawned before us and vomited forth fire, and lead, and death"_
**-- Soldier from the 20th Maine**

_"What a medley of sounds. The incessant roar of the rifle; the screaming bullets; the forest on fire; men cheering, groaning, yelling, swearing, and praying! All this created an experience in the minds of the survivors that we can never forget."_
**-- Veteran Union Soldier**

_"On we went, o'er briar, o'er brake, o'er logs and o'er bogs, through the underbrush and overhanging limbs, for about three-quarters of a mile, yelling like so many demons."_
**-- Veteran Union Captain**

_"Orders were given for regimental commanders to move up rapidly to the crest of the hill and hold it at all hazards in case Jones gave way. The woods in front were so thick that it was impossible to see more than 20 steps from our line, and all thought that General Jones held the crest of the hill. Our enemy soon hurled a heavy column against General Jones, sweeping down on his flanks and it became evident that he was pressing our men back. At this juncture, Battleâ€™s brigade moved up at a double-quick."_
**-- Soldier from the 3rd Alabama**

_"Soon the troops on our left gave way and retired in confusion. We then found ourselves isolated, the enemy upon both flanks and reported to be in rear also."_
**-- Colonel Joseph Hayes, Commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps**

_"[As we broke for the rear] on the double quick, we ran almost every step of the way back and when we got there we laid down on our backs and panted like so many hounds which had just come back in from a ten hours' chase after a gang of foxes."_
**-- Veteran of the 83rd Pennsylvania**
