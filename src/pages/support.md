## Keeping the Cadence

Every episode is a work of passion that requires a lot of coffee. I research, read, visit, host, mix, edit, and produce every episode myself.

## Turn Coffee into Episodes

I would greatly appreciate it if you enjoy this podcast, please consider supporting the show by <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/waryankee" target="_blank">buying me a cup of coffee</a> (or two) via my <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/waryankee" target="_blank">Buying Me A Coffee</a> page. All proceeds from this go into researching, scripting, producing, and hosting future episodes. Thank you for supporting War Yankee!
