War Yankee is focusing on American Civil War education. When I use a reference I try to source it here.

_"The problem with Civil War history is that all the letters home are going to have a bias. People have axes to grind, people want to make their buddies look good, and make themselves look good. The battle reports are all written from a point of view and, of course, all the reports written after the war read sort of like 'how I could have won the war if they had let me do it'. All you can do as a historian is get all those accounts together, read through them all, and see if there are some common threads."_<br />
